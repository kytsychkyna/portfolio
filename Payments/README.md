# Product analytics - user session analysis

## Overview

This project was very interesting for me as I worked with this ecom marketplace dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce
We had lots of transactional data and I decided to analyze things that would be specific to demand vs supply dynamic we have in marketplaces.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze the marketplace dynamic: we know that Pareto principle applies here and 20% of products sold on the platform generate 80% of the revenue. 
- Seller density across top product categories:
- Explore an angle of operational efficiency and segment time it takes for a seller to approve orders.
- Segment revenue per biggest Brazil regions.

## Technologies Used

- SQL
- Python

## Notebooks

- **olist_transactional_analyst.ipynb**: Notebook containing everything: SQL code snippets, Python viz, comments.
