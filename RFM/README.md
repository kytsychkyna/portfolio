# Product analytics - user session analysis

## Overview

This project was dedicated towards customer segmentation following RFM classification. I've analyzed recency, frequency of purchases as well as its monetary value of customer population. 

## Key Objectives

- Define customers belonging to these 10 groups: Best, Loyal, Needing Attention, Hibernating, Potential Loyalists, Lost, Promising, At Risk, Can't Lose Them, About to Sleep.
- Visualise segments along with some additional metrics such as Total Customers, % of Total.

## Technologies Used

- SQL
- Looker Studio

## SQL Scripts & Viz

- **rfm_query.sql**: SQL script for segmenting customers.
- **RFM_analysis.pdf**: visualisation.

## Conclusion

- There are several insights that can be attributed to this segmentation:
    - Segments of Needing Attention (22,77%) & Potential Loyalists(11,15%) beg for immediate attention as they exhibit healthy purchasing behaviour woth average spend around $600-$700 but risk of not coming back (their current avg recency is in range of 20-70 days) .
    - I would also suggest a deep-dive into Lost customers as their quantity is substantial (9,33% from total population). Ideally, we would want to drive this percentage down.
