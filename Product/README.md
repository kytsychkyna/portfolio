# Product analytics - user session analysis

## Overview

This project was an attempt to familiarize myself with how typical product data would look like and for that I used event data from Google Analytics. I decided to examine user sessions and their correlation with purchasing behavior among our customers. Additionally, I investigated variations in user sessions across weekdays.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze user sessions and purchasing behavior.
- Explore variations in user sessions across weekdays.
- Segment sessions by duration and visualize the results.

## Technologies Used

- SQL
- Looker Studio

## SQL Scripts

- **session_segmentation.sql**: SQL script for segmenting sessions by duration.
- **other_script.sql**: Any additional SQL scripts used in the analysis.

## Conclusion
